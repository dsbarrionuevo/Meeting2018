## Logistics


### Meeting location
The meeting will take place in **Bogotá, Colombia**, at the Universidad de los Andes, on **November 8 and 9, 2018**. All events will take place at the Mario Laserna building. A student affiliated with the Department of Political Science will be available at the building entrace to guide you to the event's location.

### Event format
There will be a day of public presentations which will be open to the public, and which feature two keynote talks, one roundtable discussion, and a poster session for graduate students. There will also be a day of paper workshops, which will be restricted to registered participants. During this day, previously circulated manuscipts will be actively discussed, and **no presentation will take place**. There will be a short social event for all registered participants. 

All talks and sessions will be held in English.

### Miscelanious information

- For safety reasons, **we strongly discourage you from hailing taxis on the street**. It is much safer to use Uber (which works well in the city; it is customary to take the front passenger seat first) or to arrange for a car service to pick you up. A good car service is http://www.bogotacarservice.com/. At the airport, and right after you go through customs with your bag, you will see a taxi stand on your right (along with money exchange booths). If you do not make arrangements with a car service to pick you up at the airport, it is best to approach this taxi booth and arrange for a taxi to take you to your destination then.

- Most places (including taxis) will not accept credit cards. Make sure you bring some Colombian pesos with you. 

- Tips are typically 10% of your bill, and are usually included in the service (or else your server will ask you if you'd like to include the service as they process your payment).

- English is not commonly spoken in Colombia, except in hotels.
